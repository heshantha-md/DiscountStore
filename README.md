<h2>Discount Store | iOS App Prototype</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! Iâ€™m sharing a project I developed for an iOS interview, to which I added UI/UX designs for a bit of extra flair. The UI/UX, built with SwiftUI, includes engaging animations to elevate the user experience. Go ahead and give the code a try to see its cool features for yourself. Iâ€™d love your feedback, particularly on the UI/UX aspects.</P>
<p>Happy coding! ðŸš€</p>
